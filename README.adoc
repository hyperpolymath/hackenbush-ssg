**EXPERIMENTAL: The Conway's Game of Life static site generator.**

[WARNING]
====
This is an experimental project demonstrating Game of Life as a programming language.
hackenbush-ssg proves that an SSG can theoretically be written in pure Life patterns.
====

== Overview

hackenbush-ssg is an extreme experiment: a static site generator where the
"source code" is a Conway's Game of Life pattern. The pattern encodes the SSG
logic, and running the simulation produces HTML output.

== Language Enforcement

[IMPORTANT]
====
This SSG **MUST** use Game of Life patterns as the program.

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN** for SSG logic:

* JavaScript/TypeScript
* Python
* Any conventional programming language

The host runtime (`runtime/host.ts`) provides **ONLY**:

* Load and parse RLE pattern files
* Run the Life simulation
* Read output cells at designated locations
* Write the resulting HTML to files

ALL SSG logic is in the Life pattern. The host is a dumb simulator.
====

== How It Works

1. **Pattern as Program**: The `.rle` file in `src/` IS the SSG
2. **Input Encoding**: Content is encoded as initial cell configurations
3. **Computation**: The Life simulation runs for N generations
4. **Output Decoding**: Specific cell regions are read as ASCII bytes
5. **HTML Generation**: The cell states decode into HTML

== Why This Is Extreme

* Life patterns for useful computations are ENORMOUS
* A simple adder might need billions of cells
* A full SSG pattern would be astronomically complex
* This is more proof-of-concept than practical

== Requirements

* Deno (for the host runtime)
* The Life pattern in `src/hackenbush.rle`

== Building

[source,bash]
----
# Run the Life simulation and generate output
deno run --allow-read --allow-write runtime/host.ts

# With custom parameters
deno run --allow-read --allow-write runtime/host.ts src/hackenbush.rle 10000 _site/index.html

== Why Game of Life?

Conway's Game of Life is Turing-complete, meaning ANY computation can be
performed by a sufficiently complex pattern. hackenbush-ssg proves this
by implementing an SSG entirely in Life patterns.

Named after Hackenbush, another combinatorial game studied by John Conway.
